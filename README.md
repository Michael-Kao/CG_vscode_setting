# This is my Vscode Setting for freeglut Project  

---
## How to use  
+ Use msys2 to download the newest MinGW  
+ Use msys2 to download freeglut package  
+ add glu.h and gl.h to ../include/GL/ (you can find these two files from internet or Windows SDK)  
+ clone this to your project folder   

> glu.h and gl.h may find in mesa package (a dev tool for UNIX system) but this is not work for me.
